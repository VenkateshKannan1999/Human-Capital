# Human-Capital
The intrinsic role that human capital plays in economic development is the focus of this project, which explains David J. Deming’s seminal work, “Four Facts about Human Capital.” The paper uses data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort and AFQT scores and discusses methodologies attached to understand the multi-faceted impacts of investments in human capital. Three areas related to the relationship between education and labor earnings, substantial economic payoffs of early childhood and young adulthood interventions, and the processes of developing foundational and higher-order skills are discussed. The project makes use of standardized data so as to arrive at correct comparisons and robust findings. It brings out through detailed empirical analysis how such strategic educational investments can actually raise productivity and earnings, thereby giving relevant insights to be taken by policy makers and educators. This comprehensive review puts a spotlight on how human capital investments can be optimized for increasing economic growth and improving individual economic outcomes.
